#UNDERWATER ROBOTICS PROJECT

As part of ENGR 96 (Underwater Robotics), I was Project Manager of a four-person team that built an underwater robot from scratch. I created all the 3D designs for the chassis and control box.

CAD and laser cut files for the chassis and control box can be found in the CAD-files branch.

Pictures can be found in the pictures branch.
